Two pillars of Community Helpers stand strong in controlling the expansion of this heart wrenching Pandemic : Police and Hospitals. 

Police is responsible to keep a check on social distance orders in Public Places like Roads, Markets and Public Transports. Of Course Prevention is better than Cure, so we thought how about we make the work of Police and other such authorities much much easier by giving them a real time Social Distance checking app! How about the next time a place starts to get too crowded and the authorities get notified about it instantly. How about the next time a police officer wants to check if people are maintaining social distance or not and all they have to do is open their app? YES that's the revolution we wanted to bring into their job; make it much more efficient and easy!

Similarly, Doctors are working day and night, risking their lives to treat Covid-19 patients and testing centres are exhaustively trying to conduct maximum number of tests so that infected people can be cured early and the spread of the virus could be prevented by quarantining them. Yet we hear everyday, speculation of the Pandemic data being tampered with probably due to some anti social elements. Also, countries like China and Russia have been accused of hiding the real number of Covid-19 cases and deaths. We all understand how important transparancy is in this case! Hiding the data of cases is the second biggest reason after lack of social distance why today many countries are finding it difficult to cope up with the rising number of cases.

We wanted tackle this problem by building a system that was based on a decentralised system. How better than using Etherum blochain and Matic for this purpose! Efficient, decentralised, and immutable!

# What it does?

**The Socialist Guru** -

It is a simple and small application resting in your smart phone and only requires a GPS and Mobile data access to work. It runs with abilities : 

1. It keeps running in the background and keeps detecting the number of people in your safe distance radius. As long as the number of people are within a safe number, you can rest relax and the app interface will stay green :) But as long as this number gets above a safe maximum, it will notify you and the interface will turn red until the situation improves.

2. One can also check for the same situation in any specific location they want to! Just enter the location or pin it on the map and the live data will tell you if the place safe to go or not. This will be especially useful for police and other authorities who are trying to keep a check on social distance in their premises. 

**CoronaMeter** - 

This is a very simple website built on top of etherum technology and utilises the power of Matic network to improve its capacities and affordability drastically.

Anybody with an Ethereum address can read the data on the web from knowing who the admin is to the individual details of the patients (without directly linking information, of course) like Age and Date of information. This will ensure that there is complete tranparancy in the untampered data that every citizen has the right to know.

Coming to the data entry part, there is a top level admin that has the maximum powers from registering with new Hospitals to Registering new Patients. These Hospitals only have the power to add new patient details. If the need be, the smart contract could also be modified to have vice admins who have powers in between the Admin and Hospitals. Sounds like your typical Discord group, doesn't it?

And as we all know the biggest plus point of ethereum based database management is its immutability and the fact that everything gets stored on the chain permanently. Therefore, we'll know who entered a data in CoronaMeter.
