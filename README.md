Two pillars of Community Helpers stand strong in controlling the expansion of this heart wrenching Pandemic : Police and Hospitals. 

Police is responsible to keep a check on social distance orders in Public Places like Roads, Markets and Public Transports. Of Course Prevention is better than Cure, so we thought how about we make the work of Police and other such authorities much much easier by giving them a real time Social Distance checking app! How about the next time a place starts to get too crowded and the authorities get notified about it instantly. How about the next time a police officer wants to check if people are maintaining social distance or not and all they have to do is open their app? YES that's the revolution we wanted to bring into their job; make it much more efficient and easy!

Similarly, Doctors are working day and night, risking their lives to treat Covid-19 patients and testing centres are exhaustively trying to conduct maximum number of tests so that infected people can be cured early and the spread of the virus could be prevented by quarantining them. Yet we hear everyday, speculation of the Pandemic data being tampered with probably due to some anti social elements. Also, countries like China and Russia have been accused of hiding the real number of Covid-19 cases and deaths. We all understand how important transparancy is in this case! Hiding the data of cases is the second biggest reason after lack of social distance why today many countries are finding it difficult to cope up with the rising number of cases.

We wanted tackle this problem by building a system that was based on a decentralised system. How better than using Etherum blochain and Matic for this purpose! Efficient, decentralised, and immutable!
